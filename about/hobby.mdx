Photo shooting provides a unique experience, where you can capture not only the scenery but also the current emotions.

Reading books are really fun for me, and I especially like mystery books. 
My favorite mystery book is [Journey Under the Midnight Sun](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/19256975) by Keigo Higashino, my favorite author. 
The book is a must-read for those who like mystery. 

Also a rts(real time strategy) and strategy games maniac.
