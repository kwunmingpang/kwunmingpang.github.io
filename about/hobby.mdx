## Hobbies

Playing guitar has been my hobby for a long while. I used to played in a Rock band and performed on stage when I was doing my bachelor degree. I can play both 
accoustic guitar and eletric guitar. My favorite genre is Rock and Roll.

Photo shooting provides a unique experience, in which you are not only recording the photo of current moment, 
but also the happiness, sadness and all the emotions of the current moment. 
I have been doing a lot of photo shooting recently, which you can see from my [gallery](/gallery).

Reading books are really fun for me, and I especially like mystery books. 
My favorite mystery book is [Journey Under the Midnight Sun](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/19256975) by Keigo Higashino, my favorite author. 
The book is a must-read for those who like mystery. The story may seem a bit disconnected at first, but as you read more into it, 
the more interesting and connected the whole story is. I am currently reading [Sherlock Holmes](https://sherlock-holm.es/) by Conan Doyle. 
The character depiction is really well thought and well fitted, 
and the depicted character Sherlock Holmes is a really respectable man. 

I also like playing rts(real time strategy) and strategy games, like **Starcraft**, **AOE**, **Company of Heroes**, **Heart of Iron**, but I don't have much 
time to play during the semesters. Also, I am thinking about building my own games if possible, so if anyone have an idea for an interesting game, feel free to contact me!
