## Language Skills

I can speak **Madarin** and **Cantonese** natively because my family is from Hong Kong and I grew up in ShenZhen. 
I can speak **English** fluently because I have long experience studying abroad in English speaking countries. 
I took some Japanese courses during my Bachelor degree and I passed the **N1** exam for 
Japanese using the [web app](/projects) I developed myself while studying for it.
