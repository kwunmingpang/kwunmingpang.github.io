## Language Skills

I can speak **Madarin** and **Cantonese** natively because my family is from Hong Kong and I grew up in ShenZhen. 
I can speak **English** fluently because I have long experience studying abroad in English speaking countries. 
I took some Japanese courses during my Bachelor degree and I passed the **N1** exam for 
Japanese using the [web app](/projects) I developed myself while studying for it. 

Learning new languages are an really appealing things for me, and I am looking to learn German and Spanish if 
I have the opportunity. In addition, I am looking to work on **Machine Translation** if possible, although this
is more related to Statistics over Liguistics, nontheless, it is still a very attractive topic for me.
