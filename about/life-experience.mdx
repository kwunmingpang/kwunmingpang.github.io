## Life Experience

I was born in ShenZhen and I attended school there until year 11 in High school. 
I developed an interest for Math and Science since I was in Junior high school, 
and I really liked reading some introduction books for some advanced topics 
like relativity in Physics during my free time. 

I later moved to **Miami**, Florida in the United States as an exchanged student for year 12 
and prepared for University, during which I finally have an opportunity to attend more challenging 
Math and Science courses. I took AP **Calculus**, AP **Chemistry**, and AS-level **Physics** there and 
I am abosulutely in love with these subjects. These subjects lay a foundation for my Bachelor degree and 
influence me to study in Computer Science, which is an application of Math. 

I did my bachelor degree in Computer Science in the **University of Iowa** located in 
Iowa City, the United States. I really enjoyed playing music at that time and I played as **guitarist** 
in some bands and performed on stages in my University. I devoted a lot of hours into playing and practicing 
guitar, and unfortunately the pastime activity of playing music impacted my grades for my bachelor degree 
negatively and therefore my final grades are not as desirable. 

After graduating from my Bachelor degree I decided to come back to **Hong Kong** and start working there 
because my family is in Hong Kong. I worked as a developer and you can know more about my work experience under the 
Work Experience in this page. 

After working for a few years, I gained a lot of experience with developing softwares, and I have a promising 
career and well paid job. However I feel the urge to continue my study further because I feel the need for more 
theoretical knowledge over practical knowledge. I am now studying as a **Master** student in the University of Melbourne 
to continue studying and I hope to do a **PhD** degree as well if given an opportunity.
