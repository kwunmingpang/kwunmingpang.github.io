## Work Experience

I have extensive work experience related especially web development, and building software 
in general is really interesting for me. The building of this site is a really interesting experience 
for me as well, which is available in a blog [here](/blog/project-portfolio). 

I worked for about 4 years as developer in Hong Kong. I started my career working for a small local company 
in Hong Kong. I worked as a software engineer using Java, hibernate and structs (an old Java Framework). 
I learned a lot work related experience and gained a lot of technical skills. 

After about 2 years of working there, I gained an opportunity to work for ESDLife, which is an IT company under CK Hutchison Holdings, 
a major corporation in Hong Kong famous for real estate. I worked for a project with Hong Kong Trade Council (HKTDC). My role in the project is to 
integrate Content Management System (CMS) with a front-end using Next js to produce dynamic sites for some events for HKTDC every year; 
an sample site can be found [here](https://www.hktdc.com/event/hktoyfair/en). 
There are many interesting about this job, for example, there is a dynamic form builder component similar to the google form but with a lot of requirements like validation and 
inteaction between different form components; I learned a lot of technical skills and cloud technologies while working.
