The series

$$
    \frac 1 2 + \frac 1 4 + \frac 1 8 + \frac 1 {16} + \dots 
$$

is an example of geometric series. A geometric series can be written as

$$
    a + ar + ar^2 + ar^3 + \dots
$$

where $a$ is the coefficient of each term and $r$ is the common ratio. In the example series, $a = \frac 1 2$ and $r = \frac 1 2$. 

This can also be written as

$$
    \sum^{\infin}_{k=0}ar^k
$$

The sum of the first n terms can be written as the closed form solution as

$$
    \begin{aligned}
    s_n &= \sum^{n - 1}_{k=0}ar^k \\
    s_n &= ar^0 + ar^1 + \dots + a^{n-1} \\
    rs_n &= r(s_n) = ar^1 + ar^2 + \dots + a^{n}\\
    &\text{by subtracting each term, }\\
    s_n - rs_n &= ar^0 + ar^1 - ar^1 + \dots ar^{n-1} - ar^{n-1} + ar^n\\
    s_n - rs_n &= ar^0 + ar^n\\
    &\text{now extracting the coefficient of the series}\\
    s_n(1 - r) &= ar^0 + ar^n\\
    s_n &= \frac {ar^0 + ar^n} {(1 - r)}\\
    &= a \left(\frac {1 + r^n} {1 - r}\right)\text{, for } r \neq 1\\
    \end{aligned}
$$
