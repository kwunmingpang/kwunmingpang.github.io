## sequence

> Definition:  
> 
> A (real) sequence is a function u: $\N \rArr \Reals$. 

$\N$ may be replaced by $\{k, k+1, k+ 2, \dots\}$

Sequences can be defined using subscripts

$$
    u_n = 3(-1)^n, n \in \N
$$

where u_n is the nth element of the sequence. 

### Example

Fibonacci's sequence $\{f_n\} (n\in \N)$ is defined by

$$
    f_1 = 1,\\
    f_2 = 1,\\
    f_n = f_{n-1} + f_{n-2}\ \forall \ n \ge 3. 
$$
