## Who am I

My name is KwunMing Pang, and I am from Hong Kong. I am prefer to be called Peter but wouldn't mind either way.

in **Computer Science** at the **University of Melbourne**. 

I am open to opportunities including but not limited to research opportunities, work, photo shooting, and tutoring. My current research in
I am looking for an opportunity **PhD** degree if possible, and therefore all research opportunities are welcomed for me. 

### Hobbies

Photo shooting provides a unique experience, which you are not only recording the photo of current moment, but also the sadness, happiness, 
frustration and all the emotions of the current moment. I have been doing a lot of photo shooting recently, which you can see from my [gallery](/gallery). 

Playing guitar has been my hobby for a long while. I used to played in a Rock band and performed when I was doing my bachelor degree. 

Reading books are really fun for me, and I especially like mystery books. 
My favorite mystery book is [Journey Under the Midnight Sun](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/19256975) by Keigo Higashino, my favorite author. 
The book is a must-read for those who like mystery. The story may seem a bit disconnected at first, but as you read more into it, 
the more interesting and connected the whole story is. I am currently reading **Sherlock Holmes**. The character depiction is really well thought and well fitted, 
and the depicted character Sherlock Holmes is a really respectable man. 

I also like playing rts(real time strategy) and strategy games, like Starcraft, AOE, Company of Heroes, Heart of Iron. 

### life experience

I can speak Madarin, Cantonese, English and Japanese pretty well. I passed the **N1** exam. 

I did my bachelor degree in Computer Science at the **University of Iowa** in Iowa City, the United States. 

## Work experience

I have extensive experience on especially web development, and building software in general is really interesting for me. The building of this site is 
a really good experience for me as well, which I will post a **blog** when the site is complete.
