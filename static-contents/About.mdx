### Work experience

I have extensive work experience related especially web development, and building software 
in general is really interesting for me. The building of this site is a really interesting experience 
for me as well, which is available in a blog [here](/blog/project-portfolio). 

I worked for about 4 years as developer in Hong Kong. I started my career working for a small local company 
in Hong Kong. I worked as a software engineer using Java, hibernate and structs (an old Java Framework). 
I learned a lot work related experience and gained a lot of technical skills. 

After about 2 years of working there, I gained an opportunity to work for ESDLife, which is an IT company under CK Hutchison Holdings, 
a major corporation in Hong Kong famous for real estate. I worked for a project with Hong Kong Trade Council (HKTDC). My role in the project is to 
integrate Content Management System (CMS) with a front-end using Next js to produce dynamic sites for some events for HKTDC every year; 
an sample site can be found [here](https://www.hktdc.com/event/hktoyfair/en). 

There are many interesting about this job, for example, there is a dynamic form builder component similar to the google form but with a lot of requirements like validation and 
inteaction between different form components; I learned a lot of technical skills and cloud technologies while working. 

After the long working experience, I gained a lot of technical skills, but more importantly, I am motivated to learn about the more fundamental part of the technical tools that we have in the industry. Which is one of the reason why I am back to pursue a higher education. 

### Hobbies

Photo shooting provides a unique experience, where you can capture not only the scenery but also the current emotions.

I especially like mystery books, and out of which my favorite mystery book is [Journey Under the Midnight Sun](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/19256975) by Keigo Higashino, my favorite author. 
The book is a must-read for those who like mystery. 

I am also a rts(real time strategy) and strategy games maniac. 

### Language skills

I can speak **Madarin** and **Cantonese** natively because my family is from Hong Kong and I grew up in ShenZhen. I can speak **English** fluently because I have long experience studying abroad in English speaking countries. I took some Japanese courses during my Bachelor degree and I passed the **N1** exam for Japanese using the [web app](/projects) I developed myself while studying for it.
