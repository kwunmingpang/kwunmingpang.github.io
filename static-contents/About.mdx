## Who am I

[comment]: # (add full-rounded photo of me here)

My name is KwunMing Pang, and I am from **Hong Kong**. I am prefer to be called **Peter** but wouldn't mind either way. 
I am now located in **Melbourne** to continue my study as a **Master** student 
in **Computer Science** at the **University of Melbourne**. 

I am open to opportunities including but not limited to **research** opportunities, work opportunities, photo shooting, and tutoring. 
I am looking for an opportunity for **PhD** degree if possible, and therefore all research opportunities are welcomed for me. 

My current interested fields of research are **distributed systems**, **natural language processing**, **machie learning**, and **quantum computing**. 

### Work experience

I have extensive experience on especially web development, and building software in general is really interesting for me. The building of this site is 
a really interesting experience for me as well, which I will post a **blog** when the site is complete.

### Hobbies

Playing guitar has been my hobby for a long while. I used to played in a Rock band and performed on stage when I was doing my bachelor degree. I can play both 
accoustic guitar and eletric guitar. My favorite genre is Rock and Roll.

Photo shooting provides a unique experience, in which you are not only recording the photo of current moment, 
but also the happiness, sadness and all the emotions of the current moment. 
I have been doing a lot of photo shooting recently, which you can see from my [gallery](/gallery).

Reading books are really fun for me, and I especially like mystery books. 
My favorite mystery book is [Journey Under the Midnight Sun](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/19256975) by Keigo Higashino, my favorite author. 
The book is a must-read for those who like mystery. The story may seem a bit disconnected at first, but as you read more into it, 
the more interesting and connected the whole story is. I am currently reading [Sherlock Holmes](https://sherlock-holm.es/) by Conan Doyle. 
The character depiction is really well thought and well fitted, 
and the depicted character Sherlock Holmes is a really respectable man. 

I also like playing rts(real time strategy) and strategy games, like **Starcraft**, **AOE**, **Company of Heroes**, **Heart of Iron**, but I don't have much 
time to play during the semesters. Also, I am thinking about building my own games if possible, so if anyone have an idea for an interesting game, feel free to contact me! 

### Life experience

I was born in ShenZhen and I attended school there until year 11 in High school. 
I developed an interest for Math and Science since I was in Junior high school, 
and I really liked reading some introduction books for some advanced topics 
like relativity in Physics during my free time. 

I later moved to Miami, Florida in the United States as an exchanged student for year 12 
and prepared for University, during which I finally have an opportunity to attend more challenging 
Math and Science courses. I took AP Calculus, AP Chemistry, and AS-level Physics there and 
I am abosulutely in love with these subjects. These subjects lay a foundation for my Bachelor degree and 
influence me to study in Computer Science, which is an application of Math. 

I did my bachelor degree in Computer Science in the **University of Iowa** located in 
Iowa City, the United States. I really enjoyed playing music at that time and I played as guitarist 
in some bands and performed on stages in my University. I devoted a lot of hours into playing and practicing 
guitar, and unfortunately the pastime activity of playing music impacted my grades for my bachelor degree 
negatively and therefore my final grades are not as desirable. 

I can speak **Madarin** and **Cantonese** natively because my family is from Hong Kong and I grew up in ShenZhen. 
I can speak **English** fluently because I have long experience studying abroad in English speaking countries. 
I took some Japanese courses during my Bachelor degree and I passed the **N1** exam for 
Japanese using the [web app](/projects) I developed myself while studying for it. 

Learning new languages are an really appealing things for me, and I am looking to learn German and Spanish if 
I have the opportunity. In addition, I am looking to work on **Machine Translation** if possible, although this
is more related to Statistics over Liguistics, nontheless, it is still a very attractive topic for me. 

After graduating from my Bachelor degree I decided to come back to Hong Kong and start working there 
because my family is in Hong Kong. I worked as a developer and you can know more about my work experience under the 
Work Experience in this page. 

After working for a few years, I gained a lot of experience with developing softwares, and I have a promising 
career and well paid job. However I feel the urge to continue my study further because I feel the need for more 
theoretical knowledge over practical knowledge. I am now studying as a **Master** student in the University of Melbourne 
to continue studying and I hope to do a **PhD** degree as well if given an opportunity. 

### Blogging

Blogging seems like a very interesting thing to do as well, which I planned to continue further and post more related to Computer Science or some related subjects
in my [Blog](/blog) page later. Sharing knowledge not only help others to understand things that they are not familiar with or introduce new concepts for people in other fields who 
are interested in in learning them, but also helps me as well in terms of organizing my own understanding on the topics and further deepen and reinforce my understanding.
