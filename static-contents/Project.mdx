This web-site is available on [github](https://github.com/kwunmingpang/kwunmingpang.github.io), which works as an extension to my resume and includes slices of my life. It is built with next js and served on github. Most of the contents are written in markdown file (mdx) and compiled into html using mdx Remote.

<Header title="Flash Card Web App" date="2022-05" />

This project can be accessed at [https://flash-cards-7e7fd.web.app](https://flash-cards-7e7fd.web.app).
Built it while preparing for my Japanese **N1** exam, since I need an application that can share the flashcard list between devices. It is a web application which users can input their own word list and reinforce their memory by scrolling in a virtual flashcard.
