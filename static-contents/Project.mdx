<Header title="Personal Portfolio Site" date="2023-11" />

It has been on my list for a while now, and I finally have an opportunity to do when I finish my semester one for my master degree.
I have a friend who built his own personal blog site, which inspires me to build my own portfolio site with a blog page as well.
This site not only have the blogs, but also some more details about me that I did not put on my resume.

This web-site is available on [github](https://github.com/kwunmingpang/kwunmingpang.github.io).
It is built with next js and served on github. Most of the contents are written in markdown file (mdx)
and compiled into html using mdx Remote. I will include more technical details about it.

<Header title="Flash Card Web App" date="2022-05" />

This project can be accessed in [here](https://flash-cards-7e7fd.web.app).
I built it while preparing for my Japanese **N1** exam, because I need an application that can share the flashcard list between devices,
since usually I study using my PC and I don't usually carry PC with me daily.

It is a web application which users can input their own word list and reinforce their memory by scrolling in a virtual flashcard.
Originally I use actual flashcards, but they are bulky and difficult to carry, and I was working at that time, I really want to find something
that I can use while commuting to work easily, since it usually takes me about one hour to commute.
