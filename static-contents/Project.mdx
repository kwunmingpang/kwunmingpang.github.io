<Header title="Flash Card Web App" date="2022-05" />

This project can be accessed at [https://flash-cards-7e7fd.web.app](https://flash-cards-7e7fd.web.app).
Built it while preparing for my Japanese **N1** exam, since I need an application that can share the flashcard list between devices. It is a web application which users can input their own word list and reinforce their memory by scrolling in a virtual flashcard.

<Header title="Fault Tolerant Chat Application" date="2024-05" />

This project is for **Distributed Algorithm** course. We built a fault tolerant group-chat application that allows multiple users to log in and perform instant chat similar to Wechat and WhatsApp. We implemented **Raft** algorithm that serves to create replicated state machines and distribute the data into different nodes; even when some (minority of) nodes fail, the system will keep running. This project is implemented using **Sprint Boot** and **Angular**. 
Received almost perfect marking (44/45).
