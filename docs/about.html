<p class="mb-5 text-slate-300/75">My name is KwunMing Pang, and I am from <strong class="text-blue-300/75 font-bold">Hong Kong</strong>. I am prefer to be called <strong class="text-blue-300/75 font-bold">Peter</strong> but wouldn&#x27;t mind either way.
I am now located in <strong class="text-blue-300/75 font-bold">Melbourne</strong> to continue my study as a <strong class="text-blue-300/75 font-bold">Master</strong> student
in <strong class="text-blue-300/75 font-bold">Computer Science</strong> at the <strong class="text-blue-300/75 font-bold">University of Melbourne</strong>.</p>
<p class="mb-5 text-slate-300/75">I am open to opportunities including but not limited to <strong class="text-blue-300/75 font-bold">research</strong> opportunities, work opportunities, photo shooting, and tutoring.
I am looking for an opportunity for <strong class="text-blue-300/75 font-bold">PhD</strong> degree if possible, and therefore all research opportunities are welcomed for me.</p>
<p class="mb-5 text-slate-300/75">My current interested fields of research are <strong class="text-blue-300/75 font-bold">distributed systems</strong>, <strong class="text-blue-300/75 font-bold">natural language processing</strong>, <strong class="text-blue-300/75 font-bold">machie learning</strong>, and <strong class="text-blue-300/75 font-bold">quantum computing</strong>.</p>
<h3 class="mt-8 mb-6 text-2xl font-bold">Work experience</h3>
<p class="mb-5 text-slate-300/75">I have extensive experience on especially web development, and building software in general is really interesting for me. The building of this site is
a really interesting experience for me as well, which I will post a <strong class="text-blue-300/75 font-bold">blog</strong> when the site is complete.</p>
<div class="w-full my-2"><iframe src="/assets/Peter_CV.pdf" class="w-full sm:h-96 h-64" loading="lazy"></iframe></div>
<h3 class="mt-8 mb-6 text-2xl font-bold">Hobbies</h3>
<p class="mb-5 text-slate-300/75">Playing guitar has been my hobby for a long while. I used to played in a Rock band and performed on stage when I was doing my bachelor degree. I can play both
accoustic guitar and eletric guitar. My favorite genre is Rock and Roll.</p>

<br/>
<p class="mb-5 text-slate-300/75">Photo shooting provides a unique experience, in which you are not only recording the photo of current moment,
but also the happiness, sadness and all the emotions of the current moment.
I have been doing a lot of photo shooting recently, which you can see from my <a class="text-blue-300/75 hover:text-blue-300 font-semi-bold" href="/gallery">gallery</a>.</p>

<br/>
<p class="mb-5 text-slate-300/75">Reading books are really fun for me, and I especially like mystery books.
My favorite mystery book is <a class="text-blue-300/75 hover:text-blue-300 font-semi-bold" href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/19256975">Journey Under the Midnight Sun</a> by Keigo Higashino, my favorite author.
The book is a must-read for those who like mystery. The story may seem a bit disconnected at first, but as you read more into it,
the more interesting and connected the whole story is. I am currently reading <a class="text-blue-300/75 hover:text-blue-300 font-semi-bold" href="https://sherlock-holm.es/">Sherlock Holmes</a> by Conan Doyle.
The character depiction is really well thought and well fitted,
and the depicted character Sherlock Holmes is a really respectable man.</p>
<p class="mb-5 text-slate-300/75">I also like playing rts(real time strategy) and strategy games, like <strong class="text-blue-300/75 font-bold">Starcraft</strong>, <strong class="text-blue-300/75 font-bold">AOE</strong>, <strong class="text-blue-300/75 font-bold">Company of Heroes</strong>, <strong class="text-blue-300/75 font-bold">Heart of Iron</strong>, but I don&#x27;t have much
time to play during the semesters. Also, I am thinking about building my own games if possible, so if anyone have an idea for an interesting game, feel free to contact me!</p>
<h3 class="mt-8 mb-6 text-2xl font-bold">Life experience</h3>
<p class="mb-5 text-slate-300/75">I can speak Madarin, Cantonese, English and Japanese pretty well. I passed the <strong class="text-blue-300/75 font-bold">N1</strong> exam for Japanese.</p>
<p class="mb-5 text-slate-300/75">I grew up in ShenZhen China. Later moved to US and back to HK for work for a few years, now in Melbourne.</p>
<p class="mb-5 text-slate-300/75">I did my bachelor degree in Computer Science at the <strong class="text-blue-300/75 font-bold">University of Iowa</strong> in Iowa City, the United States.</p>
<h3 class="mt-8 mb-6 text-2xl font-bold">Blogging</h3>
<p class="mb-5 text-slate-300/75">Blogging seems like a very interesting thing to do as well, which I planned to continue further and post more related to Computer Science or some related subjects
in my <a class="text-blue-300/75 hover:text-blue-300 font-semi-bold" href="/blog">Blog</a> page later. Sharing knowledge not only help others to understand things that they are not familiar with or introduce new concepts for people in other fields who
are interested in in learning them, but also helps me as well in terms of organizing my own understanding on the topics and further deepen and reinforce my understanding.</p>
