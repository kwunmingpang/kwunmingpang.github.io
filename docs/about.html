I am now located in <strong class="text-blue-300/75 font-bold">Melbourne</strong> to continue my study as a <strong class="text-blue-300/75 font-bold">Master</strong> student
in <strong class="text-blue-300/75 font-bold">Computer Science</strong> at the <strong class="text-blue-300/75 font-bold">University of Melbourne</strong>.</p>
<p class="mb-5 text-slate-300/90 text-lg">I am open to opportunities including but not limited to <strong class="text-blue-300/75 font-bold">research</strong> opportunities, work opportunities, photo shooting, and tutoring.
I am looking for an opportunity for <strong class="text-blue-300/75 font-bold">PhD</strong> degree if possible, and therefore all research opportunities are welcomed for me.</p>

<h3 class="mt-8 mb-6 text-2xl font-bold text-slate-200">Work experience</h3>
<p class="mb-5 text-slate-300/90 text-lg">I have extensive work experience related especially web development, and building software
in general is really interesting for me. The building of this site is a really interesting experience
for me as well, which is available in a blog <a class="text-blue-300/75 hover:text-blue-300 font-semi-bold" href="/blog/project-portfolio">here</a>.</p>
<p class="mb-5 text-slate-300/90 text-lg">I worked for about 4 years as developer in Hong Kong. I started my career working for a small local company
in Hong Kong. I worked as a software engineer using Java, hibernate and structs (an old Java Framework).
I learned a lot work related experience and gained a lot of technical skills.</p>
<p class="mb-5 text-slate-300/90 text-lg">After about 2 years of working there, I gained an opportunity to work for ESDLife, which is an IT company under CK Hutchison Holdings,
a major corporation in Hong Kong famous for real estate. I worked for a project with Hong Kong Trade Council (HKTDC). My role in the project is to
integrate Content Management System (CMS) with a front-end using Next js to produce dynamic sites for some events for HKTDC every year;
an sample site can be found <a class="text-blue-300/75 hover:text-blue-300 font-semi-bold" href="https://www.hktdc.com/event/hktoyfair/en">here</a>.</p>
<p class="mb-5 text-slate-300/90 text-lg">There are many interesting about this job, for example, there is a dynamic form builder component similar to the google form but with a lot of requirements like validation and
inteaction between different form components; I learned a lot of technical skills and cloud technologies while working.</p>
<p class="mb-5 text-slate-300/90 text-lg">After the long working experience, I gained a lot of technical skills, but more importantly, I am motivated to learn about the more fundamental part of the technical tools that we have in the industry. Which is one of the reason why I am back to pursue a higher education.</p>
<h3 class="mt-8 mb-6 text-2xl font-bold text-slate-200">Hobbies</h3>
<p class="mb-5 text-slate-300/90 text-lg">I LOVE playing guitar, and My favorite genre is Rock.</p>

<p class="mb-5 text-slate-300/90 text-lg">Photo shooting provides a unique experience, where you can capture not only the scenery but also the current emotions.</p>

<p class="mb-5 text-slate-300/90 text-lg">I especially like mystery books, and out of which my favorite mystery book is <a class="text-blue-300/75 hover:text-blue-300 font-semi-bold" href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/19256975">Journey Under the Midnight Sun</a> by Keigo Higashino, my favorite author.
The book is a must-read for those who like mystery.</p>
<p class="mb-5 text-slate-300/90 text-lg">I am also a rts(real time strategy) and strategy games maniac.</p>
<h3 class="mt-8 mb-6 text-2xl font-bold text-slate-200">Language skills</h3>
<p class="mb-5 text-slate-300/90 text-lg">I can speak <strong class="text-blue-300/75 font-bold">Madarin</strong> and <strong class="text-blue-300/75 font-bold">Cantonese</strong> natively because my family is from Hong Kong and I grew up in ShenZhen. I can speak <strong class="text-blue-300/75 font-bold">English</strong> fluently because I have long experience studying abroad in English speaking countries. I took some Japanese courses during my Bachelor degree and I passed the <strong class="text-blue-300/75 font-bold">N1</strong> exam for Japanese using the <a class="text-blue-300/75 hover:text-blue-300 font-semi-bold" href="/projects">web app</a> I developed myself while studying for it.</p>
